#Methods and the Python Documentation

#Methods are essentially functions built into objects.
#Methods perform specific actions on an object and can also take arguments, just like a function.
#Methods are in the form: object.method(arg1,arg2,etc...)

mylist = [1,2,3]
mylist.append(4) #.append() is a method
print(mylist) # [1, 2, 3, 4]

mylist.pop() #.pop() is a method
print(mylist) # [1, 2, 3]
